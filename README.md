## About me
Hey, my name is Paul and I'm from Poland.
I'm not a programmer.
I'm a Linux server administrator who likes to create his own software.

I like fantasy, horror movies, series and books. Sometimes I read comic books. I listen to rock, metal and related music.

But mostly I play games and develop communities gathered around games.
